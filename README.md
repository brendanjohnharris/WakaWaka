## Warning

In addition to a specific file's contents being truncated, the entire files list may be truncated if the total number exceeds 300 files. If the top level truncated key is true, only the first 300 files have been returned in the files list. If you need to fetch all of the gist's files, you'll need to clone the gist via the URL provided by git_pull_url.

[Gist Truncation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/gists/gists?apiVersion=2022-11-28#truncation)

## HTML chart

The `chart` branch also provides a simple HTML chart that displays data from the associated gist.
To use this chart, `checkout` the `chart` branch and edit the first two lines of the `dataloader.js` file to include your gist ID and github username.
Then, you can activate the github pages using the `chart` as the source to publish a live version of the chart:

</p>

This chart, available at `https://<github username>.github.io/WakaWaka/`, can be embedded into obsidian markdown as:

```markdown
<iframe src="https://brendanjohnharris.github.io/WakaWaka/index.html?start=29-04-2024&end=05-05-2024" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
```

Notice that the URL parameters, `?start=29-04-2024&end=05-05-2024`, can be used to specify the date range of the chart in the format `dd-mm-yyyy`.
